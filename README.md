# MLIR-DaCe
MLIR-DaCe is a project aiming to bridge the gap between control-centric and data-centric intermediate representations.
By bridging these two groups of IRs, it allows the combination of control-centric and data-centric optimizations in optimization pipelines.
In order to achieve this, MLIR-DaCe provides a data-centric dialect in MLIR to connect the MLIR and DaCe frameworks.

## Building
This setup assumes that you have built LLVM and MLIR in `$BUILD_DIR` and installed them to `$PREFIX`. To build and launch the tests, run
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G Ninja .. -DMLIR_DIR=$PREFIX/lib/cmake/mlir -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=$BUILD_DIR/bin/llvm-lit
cmake --build . --target check-sdfg-opt
```
To build the documentation from the TableGen description of the dialect operations, run
```sh
cmake --build . --target mlir-doc
```
**Note**: Make sure to pass `-DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON` when building LLVM with CMake in order to install `FileCheck` to the chosen installation prefix.
